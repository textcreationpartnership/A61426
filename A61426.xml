            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Conſiderations for Competitors and Electors of Repreſentatives in Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STS</hi> are things, which all men agree, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> ought to be performed with all Faithfulneſs, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with all the care and diligence, that the nature, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or difficulty of the matter doth require. Hence it is that Honeſt men, who make Conſcience of the due performance of their Obligations, are not eaſily perſwaded into ſuch Undertakings, unleſs where near Relation, intimate Friendſhip, great Charity upon ſome ſpecial advantage and need of their aſſiſtance doth move, and in ſome ſort oblige them to it; much leſs are they apt to intrude into ſuch Employments, or offer themſelves, except where there is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent need of their aſſiſtance, and upon due conſideration of their own abilities to diſcharge what they undertake: And therefore when men are without any ſuch ſpecial motives found to thruſt themſelves into ſuch Imployments, or ſtand in competition with men as well, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualifyed for the buſineſs than themſelves, this is generally looked upon as a juſt Cauſe of ſuſpicion of ſome ſiniſter Ends and Deſigns in them.</p>
            <p>This being ſo in Private Truſts, Why is it not, or ſhould it not be much more ſo in Publick, ſince they are of greater Importance? And yet it is not always in theſe? The reaſon is this: Of <hi>Publick Offices</hi> of Truſt, ſome are alſo <hi>Offices of Profit,</hi> and reaſon good they ſhould be ſo, being Offices of great Skill and Pains, and requiring the expence of living proportionable to the Dignity of the Office: And ſuch as Providence hath left to get their Livings by their Labour, may reaſonably deſire ſuch honeſt Imployments as they are duly qualifyed for. But in this there are uſually great faults committed, as 1. When men, who are in a competent, decent, and convenient way of living, are not contented therewith, but Ambitiouſly aſpiring, or Inſatiably gaping, after greater and higher Matters: Theſe are not, nor cannot be either compleat Chriſtians, or truly good Men, and when the Tentation comes, do uſually ſhew themſelves. 2. When they ſeek ſuch Places meerly for the Profit, and are not ſufficiently qualifyed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51004:2"/>duly to diſcharge the Office and Truſt. 3. When by their Intereſt or Friends, they interpoſe to keep out better or fitter Men than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; in both which caſes they do Prejudice to the Publick, and are Obſtacles and Impediments to its Service.</p>
            <p>Other Offices and Employments are of great Truſt, Honour and Authority, but of little or no Profit, but rather occaſion of Expenſe. Theſe, I conceive, are neither to be ſought for the Honour or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by any, nor to be refuſed for their trouble or expence, by ſuch as are well qualifyed for them, when they are regularly called to that Service. But of all Publick Truſts in this Nation, there is none, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſingly, of greater weight and concern than that of Enquiring, Conſulting and Acting, in Parliament; of which I ſhall ſpeak a little more particularly, as to the Perſons to be Choſen for Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Commons, and the Duty of the Electors. Each of theſe hath a double Truſt repoſed in him, the one by the Electors for the ſpecial good of the place for which he is choſen, the other by the Conſtitution of our Government for the good of the whole Nation, wherein the Religion, Lives, Liberties, Properties, and whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of all that is valuable is comprehended, and many times great concerns of other Nations alſo: And in this the Repreſentative of the meaneſt Borough hath an equal ſhare with a Knight of the largeſt County.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Qualifications of a Perſon</hi> to be choſen for ſuch a Service, ought to be proportionable and agreeable to the Extent and Weight of the Truſt, which is to be repoſed in him. As 1. <hi>Integrity,</hi> and ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity as is not to be mov'd by any proſpect of Profit, Honour, or Fear of the Faces of Men. 2. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and good Underſtanding in that variety of Matters, which may occur, and are there to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, the Principles of Laws and Government in general, and the Laws and Government of <hi>England</hi> in particular, and many other matters, with a good Sagacity, Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Foreſight, into the remote conſequences of things. 3. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Induſtry,</hi> to attend and conſider, and prepare and forward matters of Importance to the Publick. Theſe are neceſſary, if not indiſpenſable qualifications; to which may be added two others of great uſe, that is, 4. <hi>Elocution,</hi> ſo as to ſpeak pertinently and cloſely to buſineſs, and 5. <hi>Reputation</hi> of Integrity and good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which uſually makes what is ſpoken by ſuch a Perſon to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51004:2"/>be the more regarded by the reſt. Theſe five qualifications are as requiſite to a compleat Parliament Man, as are the five Senſes to a Compleat Man.</p>
            <p>Such indeed are to be deſired, to be ſought for, to be preferred and choſen, where they may be had. But where perſons thus qualified in all particulars, and in the higheſt degree, are not to be had, in ſuch caſe they that come neareſt are to be choſen, eſpecially at ſuch times when matters of great moment and concern are to be ordered. This is plain and evident, becauſe the End, which all men in ſuch caſes are by the Laws of God and Nature obliged to intend, is the publick Good, and by conſequence are likewiſe obliged to make choice of the moſt juſt and proper means and Inſtruments for the attaining of that End; and ſuch only are thoſe who have moſt of the principal qualifications aforeſaid, and in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>And by this Rule may all ſuch, both Competitors and Electors, who are more concerned to diſcharge their Duty and ſerve their Country, than to gratify their Ambition or ſerve a private intereſt, eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Actions, and judge of the actions of others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1. for Competitors, whoever, becauſe of his Quality, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Ability to ſpend moſt Money, or his intereſt among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours upon any other ſcore than the qualifications aforeſaid, ſhall oppoſe another better qualifyed in thoſe reſpects for this purpoſe than himſelf, does certainly either Act upon miſtaken Principles, or is tranſported with a vain Ambition, or has not that Affection for his Country, and Senſe of his Duty, as he ought to have. And this may be further demonſtrated from a familiar Inſtance, for there is no Wiſe and Conſiderate Man, but in his private matters of Law, in matters relating to his Health, in matters of Dealings with other Men, and the like, will ſeek aſſiſtance from ſuch as are of more Ability in thoſe reſpects than himſelf; and therefore in matters of greateſt moment to himſelf to his Poſterity, and whole Country, not to do the like, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent both with common Prudence, and that ſenſe of Duty, and of the weight of his undertaking, which every Honeſt man hath in the acceptance of but a private Truſt; and certainly mens ſo forward intruding into a Truſt of ſo great Importance, deſerves no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction than it doth, and uſually hath, in the caſe of a Private Truſt, under the like Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Rule alſo may the <hi>Electors</hi> as eaſily direct their choice,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51004:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>if they intend the Juſt and Honeſt diſcharge of their Duty; that is, if they regard only or principally the true and proper qualifications of the Perſon for the buſineſs for which he is to be choſen, and lay aſide all by reſpects and private concerhs. Some men pretend that a good <hi>Eſtate</hi> is a neceſſary, or principal qualification, to oblige the perſon to be the more concern'd for ſo conſiderable an Intereſt, but that is but a meer Fallacy; for a Covetous or Ambitious Man will be apt to uſe that as a ſtep to Sacrifice the Intereſt of his Country, to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Humour, which ſoever it is, whereas an honeſt man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his condition, will be no leſs careful to preſerve the little he hath, than he that hath more. Others are carried on upon the conſideration of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which is as unreaſonable as if a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an able Lawyer or Phyſician, ſhould make choice of a perſon but meanly Skilled in either of thoſe Sciences becauſe he is his Friend: and as abſurd and unreaſonable it is for any man to take it ill from his Friend, who chooſeth the aſſiſtance of a more proper Man in a ſpecial caſe than himſelf. The firſt of theſe does plainly prefer his private Friendſhip before the publick good of his Country, and the latter his own Intereſt or humour before either. A like miſtake is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in Cities and Boroughs, where they think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to chooſe their actual or expected <hi>Benefactors,</hi> and they again expect to be choſen. Of theſe we may judge by what is ſaid of the laſt. In the Country many are ſwayed by <hi>Fear of the diſpleaſure</hi> of their Landlords or great Neighbours, and they as unreaſonably expect their compliance. The former do in a matter of greater importance, the choice of Truſtees for their Country, what they would not do in a leſs, the choice of Truſtees for a ſmall Eſtate of their own: And the latter take from their Neighbours that Freedom, which they would not have taken from themſelves; or having baſely given up their own, would injuriouſly Uſurp their Neighbours Right, as hath often been the caſe of late times. For <hi>that Rabble</hi> of Brutes who are ready to Sacrifice all to their Bellies, they are ſcarce capable of hearing Reaſon, <hi>Venter non habit aures,</hi> but if any of them have ſo much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity left as to liſten to it, the Rule before expreſſed may-direct them.</p>
